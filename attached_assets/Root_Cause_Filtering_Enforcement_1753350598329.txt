FINAL ENFORCEMENT — ROOT CAUSE FILTERING & FAILURE MODE SELECTION
==================================================================


CONTEXT — INCIDENT #70 FAILURE:
-------------------------------
Incident: “Pump seal failure – continuous dripping observed”

System Output: Displayed irrelevant failure modes like:
- Casing Crack
- Impeller Damage
- Shaft Misalignment

This directly violates the instructions previously issued in:
✓ RCA_Initial_Questionnaire_Correction.txt  
✓ RCA_Timeline_Logic_Enforcement.txt  
✓ RCA_Evidence_Validation_Enforcement.txt

CRITICAL FLAWS OBSERVED:
-------------------------
❌ No dynamic filtering based on symptom keywords like “seal”, “drip”, “leak”
❌ Static pump-related failure modes preloaded regardless of symptom
❌ Missing contextual match to "Seal Face Wear" or "Seal Flush Failure"
❌ Confidence boosting applied without valid or parsed evidence
❌ User prompted for non-relevant checks (impeller, casing, etc.)

KEY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED BY DEVELOPMENT AGENT:
---------------------------------------------------
❓ Why is the dynamic root cause filtering logic not working consistently?
❓ Is the AI/NLP layer actually being invoked on symptom description?
❓ Why are irrelevant failure modes still visible despite enforcement files?
❓ Are you still using fallback hardcoded templates per equipment type?
❓ If logic is built, why is it not reliable in every incident? (Root cause: execution gap or architecture design flaw?)

MANDATORY LOGIC ENFORCEMENT:
-----------------------------
STEP 1: NLP SYMPTOM EXTRACTION  
- Extract terms from incident title + description: “seal”, “dripping”, “leak”, “continuous”

STEP 2: FAILURE MODE FILTERING  
- Match against Evidence Library failure modes using:
  - Keywords
  - Equipment Group+Type+Subtype if relevant (not mandatory)
- Only present modes like:
  - “Seal Face Wear”
  - “Seal Flush Line Blocked”
  - “Seal Cooling Water Loss”

STEP 3: EVIDENCE PROMPTING
- Only request evidence linked to filtered failure modes (e.g., IR scan, seal flush pressure trend)

STEP 4: DYNAMIC RCA FLOW
- User selections → Evidence validation → Confidence scoring → Recommendations

ABSOLUTE RULES:
---------------
❌ DO NOT preload failure modes based on equipment type (“Pump”, “Motor”, etc.)
❌ DO NOT hardcode any failure mode library tied to asset type
❌ DO NOT generate confidence scores without validating uploaded evidence
❌ DO NOT show generic questions for every investigation

✅ DO implement universal logic:
  - NLP-driven failure mode filtering
  - Evidence-prompt logic built from library — not hardcoded
  - Adaptive flow based on symptom + validated data

FINAL WARNING:
--------------
Every time this logic is bypassed or fails, it damages system credibility and user trust.

This failure in Incident #70 confirms incomplete or incorrectly applied logic.

Fix this comprehensively. No hardcoding must be allowed under any circumstances.

END OF ENFORCEMENT
