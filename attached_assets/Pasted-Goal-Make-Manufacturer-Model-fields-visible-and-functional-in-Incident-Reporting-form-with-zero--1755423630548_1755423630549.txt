Goal: Make Manufacturer & Model fields visible and functional in Incident Reporting form, with zero hardcoding, and integrated into the API persistence.
 
1. UI Form Changes (client/src/pages/incident-reporting.tsx)
â€¢	Add two text input fields directly below Equipment Type:
o	Manufacturer
ï‚§	name="manufacturer"
ï‚§	placeholder: "e.g., Siemens"
ï‚§	maxLength={100}
o	Model
ï‚§	name="model"
ï‚§	placeholder: "e.g., Simovert-M420"
ï‚§	maxLength={100}
â€¢	Ensure they are registered in the form schema (react-hook-form or equivalent).
â€¢	Include them in defaultValues as "" so they render reliably.
â€¢	Validation: optional strings, trimmed, â‰¤100 chars.
 
2. Backend Integration
â€¢	Incident creation endpoint must already accept manufacturerSnapshot and modelSnapshot.
â€¢	Confirm mapping:
o	If assetId provided â†’ ignore text values, use asset snapshots.
o	If no assetId â†’ store free-text values into manufacturer_snapshot and model_snapshot.
 
3. API Verification
â€¢	After form submission with text only (no asset):
â€¢	curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/incidents/<NEW_ID> \
â€¢	  | jq '{manufacturer_snapshot, model_snapshot}'
âœ… Expect typed values.
â€¢	With asset + text:
âœ… Asset snapshots override, text ignored.
 
4. Frontend Display
â€¢	In Incident Details page, show Manufacturer / Model below Equipment Type:
o	If values exist â†’ display them.
o	If blank â†’ display "Not provided".
 
5. QA / Debugging
â€¢	Browser DOM check (DevTools console):
â€¢	[...document.querySelectorAll("input,textarea")]
â€¢	  .filter(el => /manufacturer|model/i.test(el.name || el.placeholder))
â€¢	  .map(el => ({name: el.name, placeholder: el.placeholder}))
âœ… Expect two entries for manufacturer and model.
â€¢	Clear build cache and do a hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R) to verify.
 
6. Non-Functional Requirements
â€¢	No hardcoding of manufacturer/model lists.
â€¢	No conditional hiding unless RBAC dictates. (All reporters/analysts must see these fields.)
â€¢	Keep asset-priority override logic intact.
 
ðŸ‘‰ Please implement exactly as above and confirm with screenshots of the form showing the two new text fields.
