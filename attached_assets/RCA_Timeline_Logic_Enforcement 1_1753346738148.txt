FINAL ENFORCEMENT — UNIVERSAL RCA TIMELINE LOGIC (GENERATOR INCIDENT #68)
=========================================================================


CONTEXT:
--------
During testing of Generator Incident #68 (“generator fault – rotor cracked”), the system displayed timeline questions that were:

❌ Not aligned with the incident description  
❌ Generic to all generator or motor failures  
❌ Loaded even when irrelevant (e.g., winding insulation failure)  
❌ Based on static equipment templates rather than context

This indicates continued presence of **hardcoded question logic** and absence of **contextual filtering**.

WHAT IS WORKING WELL:
----------------------
✅ Core timeline anchors like:
  - Time of first abnormality
  - Alarm trigger
  - Operator intervention
  - Trip/failure timestamp
  - Recovery timestamp

These are UNIVERSAL and must be retained across all equipment types.

WHAT IS FAILING:
----------------
⚠️ Equipment-specific timeline questions are being loaded:
  - Without relevance to the failure mode
  - Without keyword matching from incident description
  - Without evidence correlation

This creates noise, user confusion, and undermines intelligent RCA flow.

MANDATORY LOGIC TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
----------------------------------

STEP 1: NLP Extraction
----------------------
- Parse title + incident description
- Extract keywords like “cracked”, “smoke”, “rotor”, “overheat”

STEP 2: Filter Failure Modes
-----------------------------
- Match keywords to failure modes using Evidence Library (e.g., Rotor Bar Crack)

STEP 3: Load Timeline Questions Dynamically
-------------------------------------------
- From matched failure mode(s), load only relevant timeline prompts
  - e.g., “When was rotor bar crack first detected?”
  - e.g., “Was there a rise in rotor vibration or torque?”

STEP 4: Suppress Irrelevant Prompts
-----------------------------------
- Do NOT ask about unrelated failure modes (e.g., winding insulation, bearing failure) unless:
  - Keyword match exists, OR
  - Related evidence has been provided

STEP 5: Manual Add-on (Optional)
--------------------------------
- Allow users to manually add extra timeline prompts if needed

ABSOLUTE RULES:
---------------
❌ DO NOT preload all timeline questions for a given equipment subtype  
❌ DO NOT use static templates for “Motor”, “Pump”, “Generator”, etc.  
❌ DO NOT hardcode logic that ties questions to equipment names or codes

✅ DO use:
  - Context from user description
  - Evidence correlation (IR, vibration, alarms)
  - NLP keyword mapping
  - Universal handling of failure modes across all asset types

FINAL NOTES:
------------
Failure to implement this logic will:
- Continue to present irrelevant questions
- Delay investigation accuracy
- Waste user time
- Undermine trust in the RCA engine’s intelligence

This timeline logic must be corrected immediately.
