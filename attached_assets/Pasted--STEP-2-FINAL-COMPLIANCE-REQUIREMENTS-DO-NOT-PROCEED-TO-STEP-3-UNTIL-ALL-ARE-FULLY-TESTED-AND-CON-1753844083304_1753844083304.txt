**STEP 2 FINAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS — DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 3 UNTIL ALL ARE FULLY TESTED AND CONFIRMED**

Read each point below and confirm with evidence (screenshots and explanation) after implementing and user testing. Do not claim Step 2 is complete until ALL requirements are met. No hardcoding under any circumstances.

---

1. **ADD ITEM**
    - There must be a button or clearly visible option to add new evidence items one by one through the UI.
    - Add form must include all required fields.

2. **EDIT ITEM**
    - Each row must have a working “Edit” button to update any field.
    - Changes must be saved to the database and reflected in the UI.

3. **DELETE ITEM (SINGLE, MULTIPLE, ALL)**
    - Users must be able to select one, multiple, or all items using checkboxes and delete them with a single action.
    - Deletion must be permanent (“hard delete”)—removed completely from the database, not just hidden or flagged.
    - After delete, the record(s) must not reappear on refresh.

4. **STICKY HEADERS**
    - Table headers must remain visible (“sticky”) at the top while scrolling vertically.
    - Both vertical and horizontal scrolling must work with header always in view.
    - Use CSS: `position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 2;` or library equivalent.
    - Provide screenshot of table scrolled down with header still visible.

5. **FILTERING**
    - Fully functional filters (dropdowns or multi-select) for Equipment Group, Equipment Type, and Subtype must be available and dynamically loaded from the database.
    - No filter options may be hardcoded.

6. **IMPORT / EXPORT**
    - Working “Import CSV” and “Export CSV” options must be available.
    - Import must accept all current schema fields.
    - Export must output all current schema fields (as shown in the UI).
    - Both functions must handle all data without omissions or errors.

7. **COLUMN VISIBILITY AND CONTENT**
    - All columns from the master schema (and current DB/API) must be present and visible in the table.
    - Long/detailed content must be fully accessible (use cell expansion, tooltips, or word-wrap).
    - No column or content may be truncated or hidden.

8. **NO HARDCODING**
    - All filtering, importing, exporting, and table rendering must be schema-driven and dynamic—absolutely no hardcoded field names, dropdown values, or static logic.

9. **USER TESTING**
    - I (the user) must be able to:
        - Add, edit, and delete individual records.
        - Select and delete multiple/all records (permanently).
        - Filter, import, export, and scroll with sticky header.
        - View all columns and contents as required.
    - Only after I have personally tested and confirmed all the above will Step 2 be approved.

---

**ACTION:**  
Implement and test every requirement above. Provide screenshots and a summary of how each item is addressed.  
I cannot approve  for Step 3 ONLY after all these points are fully completed and confirmed by user testing.  
No hardcoding allowed under any circumstances.
