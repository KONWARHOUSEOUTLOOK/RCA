## System/Developer Notes:
- Both fields are independent (users can use either or both).
- Each entry (text or attachment) must be linked to the correct incident/case record.
- Allow upload of multiple files for attachments.
- Distinguish "sequence of events" attachments from general evidence uploads in the UI.
- If possible, capture upload timestamp and user ID/metadata for each attachment.
