Universal RCA – Universal Deterministic & Pinpointed AI Addendum

The following requirements are universal and apply to all equipment types, all evidence files, and all RCA workflows, both current and future. No exceptions.

AI Determinism Requirement
--------------------------
1. For any identical parsed summary (JSON) produced by the Python backend, the LLM output and recommendations MUST be 100% identical every time for same file.
2. Implementation Controls:
   - Set LLM “temperature” to 0.0 (or deterministic mode).
   - LLM prompt must use a strict template, with keys in canonical order.
   - No randomization, synonyms, or ad hoc language.
   - If model is non-deterministic, use one that is.
3. Test: Repeated uploads of the same file must generate identical recommendations.

Pinpointed, Fault-Based Recommendation Requirement
--------------------------------------------------
4. No vague or generic AI recommendations.
   - All recommendations must be pattern-matched from an editable fault signature library (CSV/JSON/config).
   - AI must list the most probable specific fault(s), not generic terms.
   - If ambiguous, must explain and recommend what evidence is required.

No Static Example Lock-In
-------------------------
5. No examples from requirements/instructions may appear as hardcoded logic or prompts. All logic is pattern/library-driven.
