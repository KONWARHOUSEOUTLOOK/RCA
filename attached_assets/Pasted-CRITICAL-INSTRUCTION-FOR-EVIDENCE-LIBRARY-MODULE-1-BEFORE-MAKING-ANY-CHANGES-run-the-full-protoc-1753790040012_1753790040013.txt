CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR EVIDENCE LIBRARY MODULE:

1. BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES, run the full protocol compliance checker and confirm there are ZERO violations (no hardcoded dropdowns, all fields mapped to lookup tables, etc.).

2. UI and form fields for "Add/Edit Evidence" must include ALL database columns (as per the master schema below), not just a subset. No column can be omitted or hidden from the admin workflow.

3. All dropdown/select fields (Equipment Group, Equipment Type, Subtype, Risk Ranking, etc.) MUST be dynamically populated from their respective master/lookup tables in the admin section, never hardcoded.  
   - Example: If "Risk Ranking" table in admin has 3 items, only those 3 should appear in the dropdown. No extra or missing values allowed.
   - Example: "Subtype" dropdown must be linked to its Equipment Type master table, not allow free text.

4. Do not proceed with any further UI/DB work until all of the above is confirmed, compliance is proven, and you (Replit agent) confirm understanding of this protocol.

5. After implementation, provide a one-page report:
   - Protocol compliance output (no violations)
   - Screenshot of UI with all fields and correct mapping
   - Confirmation that all dropdowns are fully dynamic and reflect admin config/master data
