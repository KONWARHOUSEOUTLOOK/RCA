FINAL ENFORCEMENT — EVIDENCE VALIDATION BEFORE RCA ANALYSIS
============================================================


CONTEXT:
--------
During testing (Incident #66: “pump failed with casing damage”), the RCA system was provided with junk or non-relevant attachments as evidence.

Despite this, the system:
- Completed the RCA
- Assigned high confidence scores (85%)
- Generated recommendations
- Claimed to have used “supporting evidence” that never existed

This represents a critical flaw in RCA engine logic.

MANDATORY FIX:
--------------
✓ The system must NOT proceed with RCA analysis unless evidence files are:
  - Validated
  - Parsed
  - Matched to expected content

✓ Uploading a file is NOT equivalent to providing valid evidence.

REQUIRED EVIDENCE PARSING LOGIC:
--------------------------------
For each required_evidence entry (e.g., “IR Report”, “Torque Trend”, “Inspection Log”):

Step 1: Parse uploaded file based on MIME type
  - .pdf: extract text via OCR/NLP
  - .xls/.csv: extract tables
  - .jpg/.png: use OCR or reject if not visual data
  - .doc/.txt: scan for keywords

Step 2: Match required evidence markers
  - For “IR Report”: must find temperature readings, pass/fail verdict, thermal imaging phrases
  - For “Inspection”: must detect physical description, defect findings
  - For “Torque Trend”: must detect numeric values over time, units like Nm, etc.

Step 3: Score file as:
  - ✅ Valid
  - ⚠️ Inadequate (ask user to clarify)
  - ❌ Invalid (junk/unreadable)

Step 4: AI should prompt:
  > “The uploaded file could not be validated as a required evidence type. Please upload a clear version or correct file.”

Step 5: Only proceed with RCA analysis when minimum required evidence is validated.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
---------------------
RCA CONFIDENCE SCORE MUST BE DEGRADED OR DISABLED if required evidence is not validated.

If AI cannot confirm that “IR Report” or “Inspection” data is provided:
→ Root Cause should be deferred, and system must prompt for better evidence.

MANDATORY UNIVERSAL DESIGN RULE:
--------------------------------
❌ DO NOT hardcode any logic tied to specific equipment (Pump, Motor, etc.)
❌ DO NOT assume any file is valid based on filename or upload step
❌ DO NOT assign confidence or generate root causes unless evidence is actually parsed and validated

✅ ALL evidence adequacy logic must be:
  - Universal
  - Equipment-agnostic
  - Triggered by required_evidence definitions in the evidence library
  - Driven by real content extraction

FAILURE TO ENFORCE THIS LOGIC RISKS:
------------------------------------
- False investigations
- Wrong root causes
- Legal/compliance risk in regulated environments
- User distrust in the RCA tool’s credibility

This must be corrected immediately to protect the integrity of the platform.
