Key changes required:
1.	Question-Driven Evidence Gathering:
o	The tool must begin every analysis by asking the user (or extracting from uploaded files) a comprehensive set of standardized questions about the asset, context, operating conditions, maintenance history, symptoms, and other critical evidence.
o	Only once this information is collected and confirmed, should the AI begin its RCA logic and analysis.
2.	Conditional & Dynamic Questioning:
o	The initial questions should be broad and applicable to any asset.
o	Based on the user's answers (e.g., asset type, symptom), the tool should dynamically ask more specific, relevant questions (see the standardized question set provided).
3.	Structured Data Storage:
o	All answers and evidence must be stored in a structured way (not just free text), so they can be used directly by the RCA engine for logic and future auditing.
4.	AI Analysis After Evidence Collection:
o	The AI should only attempt to analyze root cause after gathering all necessary context and evidence.
o	If evidence is missing or ambiguous, it should prompt the user for clarification before proceeding.
5.	Explainable, Traceable RCA Output:
o	The final RCA output must include:
	Asset and problem context
	Stepwise logic and evidence for the root cause
	Contributing factors
	Confidence score and explanation
	Actionable recommendations linked to findings

Phase 1 Asset Context
1.	What is the equipment type?
(e.g., valve, pump, motor, compressor, conveyor, fan, other)
2.	What is the specific subtype or model?
(e.g., ball valve, centrifugal pump, induction motor, belt conveyor)
3.	What is the equipment's main function/service?
(e.g., process water transfer, slurry control, air supply)
4.	Where is the equipment located?
(site, plant area, line number, asset ID)
5.	What is the asset's age and operating history?
(in service since, total run hours, duty cycle)
 
Phase 2. Symptom Definition
6.	What is the observed problem/symptom?
(e.g., leak, noise, high vibration, low output, failure to start, trip, overheating, etc.)
7.	Where is the symptom observed?
(specific location: stem, seat, body, bearing, casing, wiring, etc.)
8.	When was the problem first noticed?
(date/time, during operation/startup/shutdown, after maintenance)
9.	Is the problem constant, intermittent, or recurring?
(frequency, pattern)
10.	Any alarms or interlocks activated?
(details, timestamps)
 
Phase 3. Operating Conditions
11.	What are the current and recent operating parameters?
o	Flow (rate, unit)
o	Pressure (upstream, downstream, unit)
o	Temperature (inlet, outlet, bearing, ambient)
o	Speed (rpm)
o	Power consumption (kW/amps)
o	Vibration (axial, vertical, horizontal, mm/s or g)
o	Voltage/current (if electrical)
o	Lubrication condition (oil/grease level, quality, changes)
o	Environmental conditions (humidity, dust, corrosive, ambient temp)
12.	Have any process or control conditions changed recently?
(setpoints, product/media, pressure, load, environment)
 
Phase 4. Maintenance and Event History
13.	When was the last maintenance performed?
(date, type: PM/CM/overhaul/inspection)
14.	What parts/components were recently replaced or adjusted?
15.	Was there any recent work, installation, or modifications?
16.	Is there a history of similar problems/failures on this equipment or similar assets?
(describe previous failures, corrective actions taken, were they effective?)
17.	Have any process upsets or abnormal events occurred recently?
(power loss, pressure surges, blocked filters, product changeover, etc.)
 
Phase 5. Human/Operational Factors
18.	Who was operating the equipment when the issue occurred?
(shift, operator ID, was anyone new/in training?)
19.	Were there any known operator errors, unusual actions, or deviations from SOP?
 
Phase 6. Design, Installation & External Factors
20.	Has the equipment been modified, upgraded, or relocated?
(details and dates)
21.	Is the equipment installed according to manufacturer and engineering specifications?
22.	Any external factors that could have contributed?
(weather, vibration from adjacent equipment, construction work, etc.)
 
Phase 7. Evidence & Data Collection
23.	Are there any inspection reports, photos, videos, or test results available?
(upload or summarize)
24.	Are there relevant trends or time series plots for critical parameters?
(provide if available)
25.	Anything else observed or suspected that might be relevant?
(free text/comment box)
 
Phase 8.Dynamic/Conditional Follow-Ups (AI-driven):
•	If the equipment is a valve, ask:
o	What type of actuator? (manual, electric, pneumatic, hydraulic)
o	Where is the leak (seat, stem, body)?
o	Was the valve cycled frequently before the failure?
•	If the equipment is a pump, ask:
o	What type of pump? (centrifugal, reciprocating, screw, diaphragm)
o	Were there signs of cavitation, seal leakage, or abnormal noise?
o	What was the suction and discharge condition?
•	If electrical, ask:
o	Was there an overcurrent/trip event?
o	Any signs of insulation breakdown, hot spots, or arcing?
 
Implementation Notes
•	Phase 1: Always ask the general questions (1–25) above.
•	Phase 2: Once asset type and symptom are confirmed, show only relevant follow-ups using conditional logic.
•	Phase 3: Store all answers as structured data.
•	Phase 4: After evidence gathering, pass all collected info to the RCA AI engine for structured analysis.
