Make Manufacturer & Model (text) visible in the Incident form
Files to modify (client):
•	client/src/pages/incident-reporting.tsx (or the component rendering “Incident Details”)
Requirements:
1.	Add two controlled text inputs directly under Equipment Type:
o	manufacturer with placeholder e.g., Siemens
o	model with placeholder e.g., Simovert-M420
o	maxLength={100}, trim on submit.
2.	Wire them into whatever form library you use (react-hook-form/Formik/Zod/Yup):
o	Ensure they are registered so values appear in the submit payload.
o	If there’s a schema, add optional string fields manufacturer and model (≤100 chars).
3.	Submit mapping (server already supports snapshots):
o	POST body must include { manufacturer, model } when assetId is not provided.
o	If assetId is provided, UI can still show the fields but should indicate “auto-filled by asset” (server will prioritize asset).
4.	Show on read:
o	After create, GET /api/incidents/:id should display manufacturer_snapshot and model_snapshot in the Incident Details / Step-8 header.
Do not hide behind a feature flag or role. No hardcoding.
 
Quick troubleshooting (why you don’t see them)
•	The inputs may have been added in code but:
o	Not imported/rendered in the current page section, or
o	Missing form registration (so they don’t appear / get pruned), or
o	Hidden by a conditional (feature flag/env), or
o	Failing schema validation (schema doesn’t include the fields), or
o	Cached bundle. Do a hard reload (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).
 
Fast verification steps (you/Agent)
A) DOM check in DevTools (form open):
[...document.querySelectorAll('input,textarea')]
  .filter(el => /manufacturer|model/i.test(el.name || el.placeholder))
  .map(el => ({name: el.name, placeholder: el.placeholder}))
Expected: entries for manufacturer and model.
B) Create via UI then read API:
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/incidents/<NEW_ID>" \
  -H "X-User: analyst@acme.test" -H "X-Role: Analyst" | jq '{manufacturer_snapshot, model_snapshot}'
Expected (when no assetId): snapshots equal what you typed.
C) Asset priority still holds:
•	Create an incident with assetId and text filled → manufacturer_snapshot/model_snapshot should match the asset, not the text.
 
Acceptance criteria
•	Manufacturer & Model text boxes are visible under Equipment Type.
•	Submitting with only text fields populates manufacturer_snapshot & model_snapshot.
•	Submitting with assetId ignores text and snapshots from asset.
•	Incident details & Step-8 header show Manufacturer/Model (or “Not provided”).
