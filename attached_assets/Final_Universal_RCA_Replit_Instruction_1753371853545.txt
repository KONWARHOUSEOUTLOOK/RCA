UNIVERSAL AI-DRIVEN RCA ENGINE INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT DEVELOPER
================================================================

MANDATORY WARNINGS:
--------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD ANY LOGIC, KEYWORDS, FAILURE MODES, OR EQUIPMENT TYPES BE HARDCODED.

ALL RCA FLOW LOGIC MUST BE:
- SCHEMA-DRIVEN
- EVIDENCE-LIBRARY GUIDED
- NLP AND AI INFERENCE BASED
- BACKEND CONFIGURABLE, NOT FRONTEND HARDCODED

NO STATIC IF-ELSE CHAINS. NO DEFAULT TEMPLATES BY EQUIPMENT TYPE. ALL FLOWS MUST BE BUILT USING UNIVERSAL RULES.

================================================================
RCA LOGIC FLOW (MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY)
================================================================

STEP 1: INCIDENT INGESTION
---------------------------
- Parse incident description using NLP.
- Extract symptoms, asset type context (Group + Type + Subtype).
- DO NOT preload failure modes from equipment. Use type ONLY for context narrowing if required.

STEP 2: AI-BASED ROOT CAUSE GENERATION
---------------------------------------
- Submit incident description to AI (OpenAI API or LLM):
  ‚ÄúWhat are the most likely failure causes based on this incident?‚Äù
- AI must generate hypotheses with:
  - Root Cause Title
  - Confidence (%)
  - Reasoning trace
  - Suggested required evidence

STEP 3: HUMAN CONFIRMATION LOOP
-------------------------------
- Ask user (human investigator) to confirm hypotheses:
  ‚úÖ Accept
  ‚ùå Reject
  ‚ûï Add More
- System logs hypothesis ID and decision.

STEP 4: EVIDENCE PROMPTING PER HYPOTHESIS
------------------------------------------
- For each hypothesis:
  - Prompt for relevant evidence (from AI or Evidence Library)
    ‚Üí Examples: IR scan, vibration spectrum, alarm logs, trend plots.
  - User can mark each:
    ‚úÖ Provided (upload file)
    ‚ùå Not available
    üïí Pending

- AI validates evidence for:
  - Type and content (not just file name)
  - Clarity
  - Match with fault signature pattern

STEP 5: EVIDENCE VALIDATION & RE-PROMPT
----------------------------------------
- If evidence is unclear or missing:
  - Prompt: ‚ÄúPlease upload IR scan showing seal face temp trend.‚Äù
  - Allow skip with justification if not available

STEP 6: LOW CONFIDENCE FALLBACK LOGIC
--------------------------------------
Fallback only allowed if:
- AI confidence < 50%
- No match from Evidence Library
- No usable evidence uploaded

Fallback Path:
- System shows AI-generated ‚Äúbasic‚Äù failure modes
- User selects potential root cause
- RCA continues after evidence upload

STEP 7: RCA FINALIZATION
-------------------------
- Root cause output must include:
  - Primary Root Cause
  - Contributing Factor
  - Latent Cause
  - Detection Gap
  - Confidence Score
  - Fault Signature match if found

- All outputs saved with JSON log structure:
  - Incident ID
  - Hypotheses with decisions
  - Uploaded evidence with status
  - Reasoning trace

STEP 8: LIBRARY UPDATE (CONTROLLED)
------------------------------------
- If human accepts a hypothesis not found in Evidence Library:
  - Ask Admin: ‚ÄúWould you like to add this as new row?‚Äù
    ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Add with metadata
    ‚ùå No
    üìù Modify and save

- Admin control mandatory. Never auto-update library from inference.

================================================================
AI API INTEGRATION
================================================================
- API Key must be ENV VARIABLE injected only.
- Never hardcoded into source.
- If unavailable, use fallback path.

================================================================
DEBUGGING ISSUES (BASED ON SCREENSHOTS)
================================================================
- ‚ÄúAI unavailable‚Äù triggered too early ‚Üí must only occur if all other inference paths fail.
- ‚ÄúEvidence Required: NO SYMPTOMS‚Äù ‚Üí incorrect, use faultSignaturePattern not vague terms.
- Buttons Accept/Reject not mapped ‚Üí fix frontend state binding to hypothesis.id

================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
================================================================
‚úì Human-AI loop always enabled
‚úì All AI inferences backed by evidence or symptom match
‚úì Confidence-based filtering applied
‚úì No static failure mode lists used
‚úì RCA always ends in traceable, evidence-linked inference
‚úì System logs every decision for traceability

FINAL NOTE:
===============
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT PRELOAD FAILURE MODES BY EQUIPMENT TYPE EVER.
All filtering and prompting must be driven by:
1. Incident keywords
2. Evidence Library fault signatures
3. Human-validated hypotheses
4. AI-generated reasoning

‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM MUST REMAIN UNIVERSAL AND SCHEMA-DRIVEN ‚Äî READY TO HANDLE ANY ASSET, ANY INCIDENT.
