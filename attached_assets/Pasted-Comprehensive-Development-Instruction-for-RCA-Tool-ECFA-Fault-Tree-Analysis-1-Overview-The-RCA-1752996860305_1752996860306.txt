Comprehensive Development Instruction for RCA Tool: ECFA & Fault Tree Analysis

1. Overview

The RCA tool must support two distinct investigation methodologies:

Event-Causal Factor Analysis (ECFA): For all safety and environmental incidents.
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA): For all other plant asset or equipment failure investigations.
The system must require a clear, mandatory selection of investigation type at the outset. This decision drives the workflow, forms, analysis logic, and output.

2. User Workflow and Logic Sequence

Step 1: Problem Definition
Collect an initial problem statement, including:

What happened?
Where did it happen?
When did it happen?
What is the consequence or impact?
Who detected or reported the event?
Step 2: Investigation Type Selection (Mandatory)
Prompt the user:
“Is this investigation related to a safety or environmental incident?”

 Yes (Safety/Environmental → ECFA workflow)
 No (Equipment/Process Failure → Fault Tree workflow)
This choice is mandatory and sets all downstream logic, forms, and outputs.

3. Dynamic Evidence Gathering Questionnaire

A. If ‘Yes’ (Safety/Environmental – ECFA Route):
Load ECFA-specific forms:
Event chronology and timeline
Immediate, underlying, and root causes
Barriers and contributing factors
Risk/severity assessment
Regulatory/reportable status
Post-incident actions and verification
Supporting documentation uploads
B. If ‘No’ (Equipment/Process Failure – Fault Tree Route):
Present all 8 Questionnaire Sections below. These are required prior to analysis:

Fault Tree Route: Questionnaire Sections 1–8

5. Equipment-Specific Parameters (Conditional logic based on asset type)

Pumps/Compressors: Suction/discharge pressure, vibration/noise, seal/lube, cavitation/overheat?
Vessels/Exchangers/Boilers: Operating pressure/temp, corrosion/erosion, inspection findings, relief status.
Electrical Equipment: Load/current at event, last insulation test, trip/protection device, overheating/arcing.
Control/Instrumentation: Last calibration, alarm/fault logs, power stability, wiring/connectivity issues.
6. Human Factors

Who Was Operating? (Name, shift, role)
Procedures Followed? (Yes/No, comments)
Known Operator Error? (Yes/No, explain)
Training/Competence Details (Dropdown/comments)
Recent Staffing/Procedure/Training Changes? (Text)
7. Materials and Spares

Non-OEM Parts Used? (Yes/No, details)
Material Certification/Traceability for Replacements (Upload/text)
Spare Parts Quality/Stock-Out Issues? (Yes/No, describe)
8. Contributing/External Factors

External Influences? (Power loss, utility, weather, etc.)
Upstream/Downstream Process Impacts? (Describe)
Concurrent Failures in Associated Systems? (Yes/No, explain)
Cybersecurity/Control System Incidents? (Yes/No, details)
Optional 9. Attachments and References

Upload incident reports, images, test results, etc.
Reference to Past Similar RCAs/Incidents
UI/UX Requirements for All Evidence Forms
Use dropdowns, date pickers, number fields, file uploaders.
Show/hide questions based on asset/equipment type and incident context.
All critical fields must be validated before AI analysis is permitted.
Clearly separate ECFA vs. Fault Tree forms and logic flows.
4. Data Parsing & Validation

Accept file upload: Excel, CSV, PDF, JSON, TXT. Support bulk import and drag/drop.
NLP to extract data from unstructured text (incident descriptions, logs).
Validate for completeness, units, format, duplicates, outliers.
Flag and prompt user for missing or suspicious entries.
Store data in normalized, queryable schema.
5. AI Workflow (Analysis Engine)

Applies only after all required questionnaire sections are complete and validated.

A. Data Parsing & Validation: Structure and clean user/uploaded data.
B. NLP Analysis: Extract entities, actions, relationships from free text.
C. Pattern Recognition: Find trends, anomalies, recurrences.
D. Root Cause Identification: Use Fault Tree logic (for equipment/process) or ECFA logic (for safety/environmental) as appropriate.
E. Recommendation Generation: Link findings to actionable, asset-specific or safety-specific recommendations.
6. RCA Logic and Visualization

If ECFA:
Build event chronology, identify barriers/contributors, create ECFA chart (downloadable).
If Fault Tree:
Map symptoms to causes to root cause via FMEA/FMECA and ISO 14224 logic.
Generate a fault tree diagram (downloadable).
In all cases, outputs must include:
Stepwise logical reasoning to root and contributing causes (with supporting evidence cited).
Recommendations and required follow-ups.
Confidence scores, highlight missing/uncertain evidence.
Exportable visualizations and complete audit trail.
7. User Interaction & Audit Trail

Users can adjust/edit findings, add evidence, re-run analysis.
All user edits, AI decisions, and evidence-gathering steps must be recorded for traceability and audit.
Provide tooltips/explanations for every workflow step.
8. Admin & Security

Only admin can modify equipment taxonomy, RCA/ECFA logic, or manage AI provider keys.
API keys and sensitive config must be securely stored, never exposed client-side.
Role-based access for evidence editing, RCA validation, and report approval.
Dynamic dropdown/lookup tables for ISO 14224 equipment types.
9. Testing, Validation, and Continuous Improvement

Test forms, logic, and AI workflow for all equipment and incident types (using both full and partial data).
Admin can refine questions, logic, and outputs based on feedback/audit/post-event review.
