Please review and confirm your understanding before making any changes. Do not proceed until I have given explicit permission.

Add the following fields to the Incident Reporting screen:

Operating Parameters at Incident Time
Current Gap: These are not explicitly captured at the time of incident creation.
Why Important: Early AI hypothesis generation relies on this contextual data.
Action: Add a brief (optional, but strongly recommended) field for users to enter operating parameters present at the time of the incident. Alternatively, prompt users to add this data immediately after incident registration.
Frequency and Severity of Issue
Current Gap: There is no way to indicate if this is the first occurrence, a recurring issue, or to specify the severity of impact.
Why Important: This helps the AI distinguish between common vs. rare failure modes.
Action: Add dropdowns or checkboxes to quickly flag frequency (e.g., First, Recurring, Unknown) and severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) as part of the initial form for hypothesis generation.
Contextual Factors (Recent Maintenance or Operational Changes)
Current Gap: No explicit fields for “recent maintenance performed,” “recent operational changes,” or “environmental impacts.”
Why Important: These often provide vital clues for root cause analysis.
Action: Add an optional “Contextual Factors” text field or checkboxes for commonly encountered changes.
General Instructions:

Do not alter any other working program logic or workflow.
No hardcoding:
Do not hardcode values, API keys, URLs, model names, provider names, or magic numbers.
All configuration must be admin/database/environment-driven.
No random value generation (e.g., Math.random, Date.now, etc.)—only use approved, deterministic, or admin-controlled methods.
Always run protocol_check.sh before every commit or push.
Any protocol violation is unacceptable and must be blocked.
If uncertain, check for protocol compliance before proceeding.
Confirmation Required:

Respond first with a summary of what you understood and how you plan to implement these changes.
