✅ Implementation Statement (Rephrased for Clarity)

In the incident reporting interface, group the Sample Structured Timeline Questions under a dedicated "Timeline Section", capturing them as structured fields (not just free-text). These questions should be a combination of:
✅ Universal timeline anchors (e.g., first alarm, failure time, operator action)
✅ Equipment-specific questions based on Equipment Group + Type + Subtype
This structured data will allow AI to:
🔁 Reconstruct the sequence of events
🔍 Detect lead-lag relationships between symptoms and failures
❌ Disqualify failure modes that occurred after the primary event
🧠 Map evidence (e.g., vibration spike, pressure dip) directly to the failure window
🧱 Categorization of Questions

🔹 Universal Timeline Questions (Apply to All Equipment)
Field Label	Description
First observed abnormality	When something first seemed wrong
Alarm triggered	Was there an alarm? When?
Operator intervention	What action was taken and when?
Time of failure/trip	When did the actual failure occur?
Equipment restarted	Time of recovery or bypass
🔸 Equipment-Specific Timeline Anchors
Based on Equipment Group + Type + Subtype, ask additional time-stamped questions. For example:

For Rotating → Pumps → Centrifugal

Field Label	Purpose
Vibration spike time	Link to shaft/bearing issues
Seal pot level drop time	Link to seal degradation
Suction/discharge pressure trend time	For cavitation or blockage
For Static → Heat Exchanger → Shell & Tube

Field Label	Purpose
Tube rupture observation time	Confirms physical breach timing
Differential pressure deviation time	Detect fouling or restriction
✅ AI Integration Logic

Once the incident form captures this timeline:

Events are timestamped
AI maps each symptom to potential causes
AI checks sequence logic:
“If Seal Leak occurred after shaft broke → it's not the cause”
AI filters evidence relevance
AI ranks remaining root causes
🔄 Final Output (to user or report)

“Timeline analysis shows that the vibration increased at 13:00, bearing temperature spiked at 13:30, and shaft broke at 13:47. Seal leak was detected only at 14:10. Therefore, seal leak is not a root cause, but a downstream effect.”
