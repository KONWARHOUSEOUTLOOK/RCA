Enhancements to Incident Reporting Screen
(These enhancements are in addition to all existing forms and logic. Do not modify or disrupt any existing, working features.)

1. Operating Parameters at Incident Time

Current Gap: Not explicitly captured at the time of incident creation.
Why Important: Early AI hypothesis generation relies on this contextual data.
Action: Add a brief (optional, but strongly recommended) field for users to enter operating parameters present at the time of the incident. Alternatively, prompt users to add this data immediately after incident registration.
2. Frequency and Severity of Issue

Current Gap: No field to indicate first occurrence, recurring issue, or to specify severity of impact.
Why Important: Helps the AI distinguish between common vs. rare failure modes.
Action: Add dropdowns or checkboxes to flag frequency (e.g., First, Recurring, Unknown) and severity (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) as part of the initial form for hypothesis generation.
3. Contextual Factors (Recent Maintenance or Operational Changes)

Current Gap: No explicit fields for “recent maintenance performed,” “recent operational changes,” or “environmental impacts.”
Why Important: These provide vital clues for root cause analysis.
Action: Add an optional “Contextual Factors” text field or checkboxes for commonly encountered changes.
General Instructions:

Do not alter any other existing, working program logic or workflow.
No hardcoding:
Do not hardcode values, API keys, URLs, model names, provider names, or magic numbers.
All configuration must be admin/database/environment-driven.
No random value generation (e.g., Math.random, Date.now, etc.); only use approved, deterministic, or admin-controlled methods.
Always run protocol_check.sh before every commit or push.
Any protocol violation is unacceptable and must be blocked.
If uncertain, check for protocol compliance before proceeding.
Confirmation Required:
