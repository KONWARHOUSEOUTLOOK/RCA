Imagine the report says:

“Pump shaft broke and bearing seized”
Here’s how AI logic chaining handles this:

🔹 Step 1: Parse Observed Failures
AI detects:

symptoms = ["Shaft Breakage", "Bearing Failure"]
🔹 Step 2: Chain Elimination Logic
From your elimination table:

Shaft Breakage → eliminate Seal Leak, Motor Overload
Bearing Failure → eliminate Motor Overload, Seal Leak (again)
AI intersects logic and confirms:

eliminated = ["Seal Leak", "Motor Overload", "Casing Crack"]
🔹 Step 3: Ask Only Relevant Questions
AI routes questioning toward:

Misalignment
Fatigue
Lubrication
🧠 So it asks:

"Was there a misalignment record before failure?"
"Was the pump exposed to cyclic loading?"
"Any signs of dry bearing operation?"
And avoids:

✖ “Was seal pot low?”
✖ “Was there a current trip?”
❗ Contradiction Checking in Real Time

If user answers:

“No misalignment, no cyclic load, lubrication normal”
Then:

AI detects contradiction: “Shaft + bearing can’t fail without any of these.”
It flags: "Insufficient or incorrect input data — reevaluate symptom or check for missing evidence."
This is what human experts do intuitively.

✅ What Logic Chaining Requires

Component	Role
🔗 Rule Engine	Chains elimination logic based on current inputs
🧠 NLP Parser	Extracts symptoms from free-text failure reports
📚 Knowledge Base	Contains questions, failure logic, exclusions
🧭 Reasoning Agent	Routes the next question based on current answers
❌ Conflict Detector	Flags contradictions or low-confidence paths
🔧 How You Can Implement (in your tool)

Embed elimination + diagnostic questions in the RCA file (you’ve already started!)
Use AI/NLP to:
Parse symptom reports
Trigger matching logic rows
As user answers:
Update “possible causes”
Route next most relevant question
Once all but 1–2 causes remain → report RCA with confidence score
🚀 Final Output Becomes:

“Based on reported failure (shaft break + bearing seized), and your answers:
Misalignment is 80% likely
Fatigue is 60%
Seal leak, casing crack, overload have been ruled out.”
