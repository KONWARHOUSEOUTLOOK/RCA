Fallback Logic for RCA System When Evidence Library Confidence Is Low
=====================================================================

üìÖ Generated: 2025-07-24 11:50:43

This document defines universal logic for the AI-based RCA system when evidence confidence from the Evidence Library is LOW or NOT MATCHED. This ensures continuity of intelligent analysis without fallback to hardcoded equipment logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
üö´ ABSOLUTE RULE: NO HARDCODING ALLOWED
- Do not preload equipment-specific failure modes or symptoms
- Do not fallback to static templates
- All logic must be AI-driven or schema-driven
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Logic

1Ô∏è‚É£ FALLBACK TO AI-ONLY INFERENCE
----------------------------------
- When no Evidence Library entry matches with high confidence (>80%), the system must use OpenAI or equivalent LLM to infer potential failure modes.
- Prompt example: 
  "Based on the following incident description and symptoms, what are the  most likely root causes?"

- Context provided:
    - Incident ID
    - Equipment Group / Type / Subtype
    - Extracted keywords/symptoms from NLP
    - Attached evidence summary (if any)

2Ô∏è‚É£ DISPLAY INFERRED FAILURE MODES (LABELLED)
---------------------------------------------
- Any failure modes returned by AI should be tagged clearly:
  "confidenceSource": "AI-Inferred"

- Present them in the UI alongside confidence scores (if available), and note that these were *not* matched from the library.

3Ô∏è‚É£ COLLECT INVESTIGATOR FEEDBACK
----------------------------------
- Ask investigator for action:
  [ ] Confirm one or more inferred causes
  [ ] Disagree with all
  [ ] Suggest alternative
  [ ] Add custom failure mode manually

4Ô∏è‚É£ TEMPORARY LOCAL USE ONLY
-----------------------------
- Inferred causes, if confirmed, can be used to drive evidence gathering and conclusion *for this incident only*
- DO NOT update the Evidence Library yet

5Ô∏è‚É£ OPTIONAL FLAGGING FOR REVIEW
---------------------------------
- Allow system to log unmatched inferences into a "review queue"
  Fields to log:
  - Incident ID
  - Inferred Failure Mode
  - Evidence Summary
  - User Confirmation Status
  - Confidence (if calculated)
  - Timestamp

6Ô∏è‚É£ ESCALATE IF REPEATED PATTERNS EMERGE
-----------------------------------------
- If same unmatched cause is confirmed by multiple human investigators across incidents:
  - Flag for admin/manual review
  - THEN and ONLY THEN consider adding to Evidence Library

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

{
  "incidentID": "INC-078",
  "equipmentGroup": "Rotating",
  "equipmentType": "Pump",
  "subtype": "Seal Leak",
  "inferredCause": "Seal Flush Line Blocked",
  "confidenceSource": "AI-Inferred",
  "userConfirmed": true,
  "evidenceSummary": ["IR image provided", "Leak rate log"],
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T19:55:00Z"
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìå Reminder:
- No hardcoded lists
- No static if-else chains
- All analysis, prompting, and logging must be schema-based and universally applicable
