UNIVERSAL RCA SYSTEM LOGIC
===========================

This is the FINAL UNIVERSAL RCA INSTRUCTION DOCUMENT for Replit Agent.

ABSOLUTE RULE:
- ❌ NO HARDCODING of equipment group, type, subtype, failure modes, symptoms, keywords, or prompts under ANY circumstance.
- ✅ ALL LOGIC MUST BE BUILT GENERICALLY using schema-driven configuration and AI/NLP-based reasoning.

--------------------------------------
SYSTEM FLOW — UNIVERSAL RCA BACKEND
--------------------------------------

STEP 1: INCIDENT INGESTION
--------------------------
- Extract symptoms, equipment identifiers, timeline markers, and keywords using universal NLP (no static keyword lists).
- If input is vague (e.g., "equipment failed"), AI must:
  • Prompt for clarifying detail: “Did the failure involve vibration, leak, noise, temperature, or stoppage?”
  • Recommend evidence types based on asset subtype (e.g., for pump: seal report, vibration, IR).
- Save user selections and input history.

STEP 2: UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT CONTEXT MAPPING
-------------------------------------------
- Use combination of Equipment Group + Type + Subtype to filter the Evidence Library schema.
- No hardcoded paths — must dynamically reference schema entries for:
  • Required trend data
  • Fault signature patterns
  • Recommended evidence
  • Prompt templates

STEP 3: AI-GENERATED FAILURE MODE HYPOTHESES
--------------------------------------------
- Based on the incident NLP + evidence library + AI backend:
  • AI suggests most likely failure modes (e.g., for pump seal leak: Seal Face Wear, Flush Blockage).
  • Human investigator can:
    ✅ Accept
    ❌ Reject
    ➕ Add more
- If human modifies, AI reevaluates implications and updates evidence requirements.
- All hypotheses must have UUIDs, not static ID numbers.

STEP 4: EVIDENCE PROMPTING LOGIC
--------------------------------
- Based on filtered failure modes, AI prompts only relevant evidence.
- User may respond: "Available", "Not Available", "Will Upload", or "Unknown".
- AI must NOT continue RCA if critical evidence is not confirmed.
- AI logs evidence gaps and provides suggestions (e.g., “Vibration waveform is missing — upload if available”).

STEP 5: DATA ANALYSIS & MATCHING
--------------------------------
- When data is uploaded:
  • AI interprets attachments (IR scan, vibration, trend, etc.) using fault signature matching from Evidence Library.
  • If match confidence > 85%, mark as High-Confidence Root Cause.
  • If < 85%, fallback logic must activate (see Step 6).
  • All analysis logged with source, timestamp, matching confidence, and AI reasoning.

STEP 6: LOW-CONFIDENCE RCA FLOW
-------------------------------
- If:
  • No clear match from evidence
  • Or user skips critical data
- AI must:
  • Trigger fallback RCA engine
  • Ask human investigator for hypotheses
  • Provide example failure trees and assist with logic-building
  • Allow user to escalate to SME or request further clarification

STEP 7: RCA OUTPUT STRUCTURE
----------------------------
Each RCA output must include:

- Primary Root Cause (AI-inferred + Human-confirmed)
- Contributing Factors (from evidence or expert input)
- Latent Conditions
- Detection Gaps
- Fault Signature Match (Yes/No, % Confidence)
- Applicable to Other Equipment? (Yes/No)
- Confidence Level: High / Medium / Low
- Diagnostic Value Score: 1–5
- Required Action Items
- ⬛ NEW — PSM Integration Fields:
  • PHA Reference
  • SIS Compliance Check (IEC 61511)
  • MOC References
  • Safety Device Functional History

STEP 8: ADMIN REVIEW & LIBRARY UPDATE
-------------------------------------
- If user provides new, valid evidence and AI detects new patterns:
  • AI proposes library enhancement (new fault signature, new prompt style).
  • Admin (not system) must approve entries: ✅ Accept / ❌ Reject / 🛠 Modify
- No automatic update of Evidence Library — must be confirmed by authorized admin.

STEP 9: HISTORICAL LEARNING
---------------------------
- System stores patterns from previous RCA for:
  • Similar symptoms
  • Equipment combinations
  • Incident context
- These patterns influence future AI inference for better alignment.

---------------------------------------
INSTRUCTION SUMMARY TO REPLIT TEAM
---------------------------------------

✅ NO HARDCODING: Never insert static lists for pumps, seals, motors, or symptoms. All logic must come from:
  • Evidence_Library.csv
  • NLP-parsed incident descriptions
  • AI-backed suggestion generation

✅ HUMAN CONTROL: RCA is AI-assisted, not AI-only. Investigator can:
  • Accept/reject/modify AI outputs
  • Add manual hypotheses
  • Provide or deny evidence
  • Stop or escalate the RCA

✅ SMART INTEGRATION:
  • Use incident + symptom + history + evidence + evidence gaps + PSM context
  • All flows must degrade gracefully if data is missing

--------------------------------------
LOGIC CHECKLIST BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
