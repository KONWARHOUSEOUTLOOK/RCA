00:10	Equipment tripped again
01:00	Technician on site
5. Evidence Collected
Type	Source / File	Observations
Vibration Trends	DCS trend chart	Spike 12 hrs before failure
Thermal Images	FLIR camera	Hotspot on DE bearing
Inspection Report	Mechanical team	Oil degraded, bearing scored
Photos	Attached	Discoloration on housing
6. Root Cause Summary
Classification	Description
Primary Root Cause	e.g., Lube oil starvation due to clogged filter
Contributing Factors	e.g., Overload, poor oil quality
Latent/Systemic Cause	e.g., No oil filter replacement interval in PM
Detection Gaps	No online oil quality monitoring, delayed alarm response
7. Root Cause Analysis Methodology
Example: 5-Whys, Fishbone (Ishikawa), Fault Tree, Apollo RCA
📌 You may include a diagram or logic tree here for clarity.
