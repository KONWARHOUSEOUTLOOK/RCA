AI RCA Checklist Logic Violation â€“ Incident #72 (Pump Seal Leak)
=================================================================

ðŸ“Œ Incident Summary:
--------------------
Incident #72 Description: "Pump seal leaking â€“ slight dripping, no abnormal noise"

System Behavior:
- Displayed failure modes: Bearing Failure, Casing Crack, Impeller Damage, Misalignment, Motor Overload, Seal Leak
- Only one failure mode ("Seal Leak") was correct
- System incorrectly retained irrelevant failure modes

ðŸš« Checklist Logic Violations:
------------------------------
1. Equipment-Type Preloading Still Active:
   â€¢ System is still loading all "Pump" failure modes regardless of symptom match
   â€¢ Evidence: Bearing, Impeller, Motor modes appearing for simple "seal leak" report

2. Fault Signature Pattern Match Not Primary Filter:
   â€¢ System does not prioritize symptom tokens like "seal", "leak", "drip" in filtering
   â€¢ Symptom-based filtering should eliminate any mode without matching pattern

3. Confidence Threshold Not Applied:
   â€¢ No confidence scores shown to justify why modes like "Casing Crack" appeared
   â€¢ Modes below 60% symptom relevance should be excluded automatically

4. Equipment â†’ Failure Mode architecture is still present:
   â€¢ System seems to follow: Equipment â†’ Failure Modes â†’ Symptom Matching
   â€¢ CORRECT approach: Symptom Tokens â†’ Failure Modes (via Evidence Library) â†’ Equipment back-inferred if needed

ðŸ§  What Should Happen:
-----------------------
- NLP engine should extract: ["seal", "leak", "dripping"]
- Evidence Library filtered where `faultSignaturePattern` contains â‰¥1 symptom token
- Only matching failure modes shown
- All others eliminated
- AI must prompt for more data ONLY if insufficient to proceed (not preload others)

âœ… Required Fix Actions:
------------------------
1. ðŸš« Eliminate equipment-type failure mode dictionaries
2. ðŸš« Stop all fallback lists based on group/type/subtype
3. âœ… All filtering must begin with symptom keyword extraction from user incident text
4. âœ… Evidence Library must be indexed and queried by faultSignaturePattern relevance
5. âœ… Any failure mode below confidence threshold (e.g. 60%) should be omitted
6. âœ… Only show fallback option if NO match is found â€“ prompt for clarification instead
7. ðŸ§¾ Required audit logging JSON format per enforcement doc

ðŸ”’ ABSOLUTE RULE â€“ NO HARDCODING:
----------------------------------
Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCE** may the system:
- Preload failure modes from equipment metadata
- Use static dictionaries or lists tied to equipment group/type/subtype
- Trigger fallbacks unless explicitly justified by missing symptoms
- Use switch-cases, hardcoded maps, or static arrays of failure templates

âœ… Final Instruction:
---------------------
All questionnaire generation, failure mode elimination, and evidence prompts must be generated **dynamically** based solely on symptom tokens extracted from incident descriptions, compared against `faultSignaturePattern` entries in the Evidence Library. This must be true for ALL equipment types â€” **no exceptions**.
