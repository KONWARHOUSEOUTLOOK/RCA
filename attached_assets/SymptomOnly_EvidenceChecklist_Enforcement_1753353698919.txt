Symptom-Only Evidence Checklist Enforcement ‚Äì Incident #72 (Pump Seal Leak)
============================================================================

üîç Root Problem:
----------------
The AI-generated Evidence Checklist for Incident #72 includes **irrelevant failure modes and evidence types**, such as:
- SF6 Leak
- Refrigerant Leak
- Tube Leak
- Roof Corrosion
- Cylinder Leak
- Steam Leak

The symptom described was ONLY: "Pump seal leaking ‚Äì dripping continuously"

This violates the checklist logic and indicates one or more of the following implementation failures:
‚ùå Equipment-type-based evidence preloading
‚ùå Loose evidence library tagging (e.g., all leak-related items shown for any "Pump")
‚ùå Lack of strict `faultSignaturePattern` filtering against extracted symptoms

üõë This behavior is **unacceptable** for a system meant to be universal and symptom-driven.

‚úÖ Correct Logic Architecture:
------------------------------
1. ‚û§ Incident text is the **only source** for initial filtering.
   - Extract tokens: ["seal", "leak", "dripping"]
   - Tokens must be matched against `faultSignaturePattern` in the Evidence Library

2. ‚û§ Evidence Library filtering must obey:
   a. `faultSignaturePattern` CONTAINS extracted symptom tokens
   b. `symptomType` is relevant to the symptom (e.g., "Leak", "Seal", "Face Wear")
   c. `Component Group/Type/Subtype` is compatible ONLY if derived post-filter

3. ‚û§ No unrelated domain evidence is ever shown (e.g., SF6, HVAC, exchangers)

4. ‚û§ No fallback to equipment-type-specific templates, dictionaries, or hardcoded suggestions

‚úÖ Mandatory Output Behavior:
-----------------------------
For Incident #72, only relevant evidence types should appear, such as:
- Seal face temperature (IR)
- Seal pot pressure/level
- Flush line pressure
- Local leak detection sensor trend
- Operator photos of leak
- Alarm/event log around time of leak

üß± Required Enforcement Structure:
----------------------------------
- Primary Filter: NLP symptom keywords ‚Üí Evidence Library `faultSignaturePattern`
- Secondary Match (optional): Relevant domain + symptomType
- Confidence score applied to each evidence item
- No evidence shown below confidence threshold (e.g., <0.6)

‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
-------------------------
- ‚ùå Static dictionaries of evidence per equipment type
- ‚ùå Loading all "leak"-tagged evidence just because it's a pump
- ‚ùå Using group/type/subtype to preload default failure modes or evidence
- ‚ùå Switch-case, object maps, or any hardcoded fallback
- ‚ùå Displaying generic evidence prompts not tied to symptom match

‚úÖ Every decision must be made dynamically using NLP ‚Üí pattern match ‚Üí scoring ‚Üí audit log

‚ö†Ô∏è Summary:
-----------
This violation shows the system is still relying on legacy behavior or template-style fallback logic. That must be **completely removed**. 

The only driving logic for evidence prompting must be **incident-specific symptom extraction**, not equipment type.

üìé Incident #72 must be re-run after applying this correction and verified to show ONLY seal-related evidence prompts.
