1. Data Inputs & Parsing

A. Input Types

Work order data (Excel, CSV, PDF, JSON, text, etc.)
Free-text descriptions (symptoms, actions, events)
Structured operating data (flow, pressure, cycles, temperature, etc.)
Maintenance history, event/condition logs
B. Data Cleaning & Normalization

Handle missing, misaligned, or partial records
AI/ML/NLP to extract key info from unstructured text (e.g., “valve leaking at seat”)
Map data fields to standardized RCA schema
2. Asset and Context Understanding

A. Asset Identification

Parse equipment type (valve, pump, motor, conveyor, etc.)
Parse subtype/model/class (ball valve, centrifugal pump, etc.)
Parse key attributes (location, ID, age, duty, service type)
B. Symptom Localization

Extract main issue (leak, overheat, noise, failure, low output, etc.)
Localize affected part (e.g., “leak at stem” vs. “leak at body”)
Extract when/how symptom manifested (after PM, during operation, sudden/gradual)
3. Stepwise RCA Logic

A. Rule-Based & Data-Driven Reasoning

Use a knowledge base (industry standards, OEM manuals, historical plant data, FMEA/FMECA tables) to map:
Asset type + symptom → typical failure modes
Part affected → likely causes
Process context (e.g., pressure spikes, maintenance overdue, abnormal temperature, operator action)
B. Cause-and-Effect Mapping

For every symptom, generate a cause-and-effect tree (Fishbone/Ishikawa or Apollo logic tree)
Correlate with historical and real-time data (parameter excursions, recent work orders, alarms/events)
C. Probable Cause Validation

For each possible cause, score based on supporting/refuting evidence in the data
Use statistical correlation if possible (e.g., “high vibration always precedes seal failure”)
List multiple possible causes if evidence is ambiguous; flag “inconclusive” with missing data prompts
4. AI-Driven User Interactions (Evidence Gathering)

A. Missing Data Prompts

If key data is missing, automatically prompt user/admin:
“Asset type not specified—please select: Ball Valve / Gate Valve / Other”
“No recent maintenance history—please confirm last PM date”
“No pressure trend data—upload if available for more accurate RCA”
B. Progressive Querying

Only ask for information relevant to narrowing down root cause (“Was the valve cycling frequently before the leak?”)
Allow user to provide clarification, then re-run RCA with new evidence
5. Confidence Scoring & Output Explanation

A. Confidence Rating

Calculate a confidence score based on the match between data and typical failure models
High: clear, matching evidence
Medium: some evidence, possible ambiguity
Low: insufficient/contradictory data
B. Explainable Output

Each conclusion must include a plain English explanation:
The asset type, the specific symptom, the affected subsystem
Why this root cause was chosen (data-driven logic: “Pressure spikes + overdue maintenance + seat leak = likely seat failure”)
Contributing factors (e.g., process upsets, operator error, late PM)
Data/evidence references (timestamps, parameters, work orders)
“Missing data” warning if applicable
6. Recommendations Engine

Generate actionable recommendations directly linked to the root/contributing causes
Recommendations should be equipment/symptom-specific (e.g., “replace valve seat, install surge protector, revise lubrication schedule”)
If root cause is inconclusive, recommend additional data collection or inspection
7. Customizability & Continuous Learning

Allow admin to add/edit equipment types, common symptoms, RCA logic rules, and parameter mappings (future-proofing)
AI/engine should learn from corrected/manual RCAs and incorporate feedback over time (closed-loop improvement)
8. Visualizations

Show RCA reasoning path as a tree (root → cause → contributing factors → evidence)
(e.g., Fishbone/Ishikawa, Apollo tree)
Show parameter trends/time series supporting the conclusion
Visual “missing data” indicators if critical info is unavailable
9. Sample AI Reasoning Output (Template)

Asset: Centrifugal Pump (ID: P123)
Symptom: Seal Leak

Stepwise Analysis:
- Equipment type: Centrifugal pump
- Main symptom: Fluid leak at seal area
- Historical data: High vibration 2 weeks prior, temperature excursion, seal last replaced 30 months ago (PM frequency: 24 months)
- Probable causes evaluated:
   1. Seal wear due to extended service life (supported by overdue PM, wear evidence)
   2. Cavitation due to process upsets (not supported, flow/pressure normal)
   3. Installation error (no recent installation)

Root Cause: Seal wear (confidence: 92%)
Contributing Factor: Late PM

Explanation: The combination of high vibration, over-extended seal life, and location of leak indicates seal wear as the root cause, with late preventive maintenance as a contributing factor.

Recommendations: Replace seal, review and enforce PM schedule, monitor vibration monthly.
10. Technical Integration Notes

All AI analysis must be server-side; never expose RCA logic or sensitive data to frontend.
Support for multi-language/nomenclature as needed (valve = “valve”, “valvula”, etc.).
Log all AI prompts, user clarifications, and manual overrides for audit and continuous improvement.
11. Testing & Validation

Test cases should include:
Complete and incomplete data
Various equipment types and symptoms
Contradictory evidence (AI must flag low confidence/inconclusive)
Manual correction/feedback loop
