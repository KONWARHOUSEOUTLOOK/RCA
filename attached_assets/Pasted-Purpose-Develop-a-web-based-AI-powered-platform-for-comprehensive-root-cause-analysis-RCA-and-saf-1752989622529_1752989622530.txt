Purpose

Develop a web-based AI-powered platform for comprehensive root cause analysis (RCA) and safety investigation.

Plant Asset RCA: Based on fault tree (or failure logic tree) for equipment failures.
Safety/Incident RCA: Based on Event-Causal Factor Analysis (ECFA) or similar methodologies.
1. Data Ingestion, Parsing & Validation

A. File Upload & Supported Formats:

Accept Excel, CSV, PDF, JSON, and TXT.
Support bulk import and drag-and-drop functionality.
B. Data Parsing:

Parse structured and unstructured work order, incident, and maintenance data.
NLP to extract entities, parameters, events, and relationships from free text (incident descriptions, operator logs, notes).
C. Data Validation:

Validate for completeness, correct units/formats, duplicates, outliers.
Flag and prompt user for missing or suspicious entries.
Store data in normalized, queryable schema.
2. Questionnaire-Driven Evidence Gathering (Form Builder)

A. General Approach:

Implement a dynamic questionnaire/form system, starting with broad questions and drilling down based on user answers and ISO 14224 taxonomy.
The form must adapt based on selected equipment, event, or incident type (see conditional logic).
A.1. Equipment/Asset Types
(Based on ISO 14224—must be expandable)

Rotating: Pumps (centrifugal, reciprocating, rotary), compressors, turbines, motors, fans, blowers, mixers.
Static: Vessels, exchangers, boilers, columns, filters, tanks, piping, valves.
Electrical: Switchgear, transformers, circuit breakers, UPS, cables.
Instrumentation/Control: Sensors, transmitters, control valves, analyzers, PLC/DCS.
Support: HVAC, cranes, fire protection, others.
A.2. Evidence-Gathering Questionnaire
A. General Information

Equipment Tag/ID (text)
Equipment Type (dropdown, per taxonomy)
Subtype/Model (dropdown or text)
Manufacturer
Year of Installation
Location/Area (site, process line)
Parent System/Asset Hierarchy
B. Failure/Event Details

Date & Time of Event
Who Detected Problem (operator, technician, system alarm)
How was the problem first noticed? (dropdown: alarm, inspection, operator report, etc.)
Operating mode (normal, startup, shutdown, standby)
Was equipment running, idle, or standby at failure?
Environmental conditions (ambient temp, humidity, weather, corrosive/dusty)
C. Symptom and Evidence

Describe problem/failure (free text + NLP extraction)
Where is the symptom? (e.g., for valve: seat, stem, body)
Is the problem constant, intermittent, or recurring?
Were any alarms or trips triggered? (list, timestamps)
Any abnormal readings? (pressure, temp, flow, current, etc.)
Photographs or supporting docs? (upload)
Any safety/environmental impact?
D. Operating and Maintenance History

Type of last maintenance (PM, CM, PdM)
Details of recent work, modifications, or repairs
History of similar failures? (dropdown/description)
Operating within design limits? (yes/no, explain)
Recent process upsets, trips, or abnormal ops?
E. Equipment-Specific Parameters (conditional on equipment type)

Pumps/Compressors: Suction/discharge pressure, vibration/noise, seal/lube condition, cavitation/overheat?
Vessels/Exchangers/Boilers: Operating P&T, corrosion, inspection findings, relief device status.
Electrical: Load/current, last insulation resistance, trip records, overheating/arcing.
Control/Instrumentation: Last calibration, alarm/fault logs, power supply, wiring issues.
F. Human Factors

Any known operator error?
Training/competence details
Recent staffing/procedure changes?
G. Materials & Spares

Associated system failures
Any cyber/automation incidents
I. Safety/Incident (ECFA-Specific)

Chronology: Time of first indication, alarms, responses, interventions, restoration.
Incident severity/risk rating
Immediate & underlying causes (dropdown + free text)
Regulatory/Reportable event? (yes/no)
Formal investigation initiated? (yes/no)
Post-incident actions taken and verification/closure
J. Attachments & References

Upload incident reports, images, test results
Reference past similar RCAs/incidents (if in system)
A.3. UI/UX Notes
Use dropdowns, date pickers, number fields, file uploaders.
Conditional logic: show/hide questions based on context (e.g., equipment type, event severity).
All required fields must be validated before allowing AI analysis to proceed.
3. AI Workflow (Analysis Engine)

A. Data Parsing & Validation
What: Cleans and structures user-entered/uploaded data.
Why: Ensures analysis uses high-quality, valid data.
Status/Tooltip: "Checking your input for completeness and format..."
B. NLP Analysis
What: Extracts entities, actions, and relationships from text descriptions, logs, notes.
Why: Converts unstructured data into structured evidence for analysis.
Status/Tooltip: "Understanding incident narratives and operator comments..."
C. Pattern Recognition
What: Identifies patterns, trends, or anomalies in parameter history, events, maintenance, etc.
Why: Finds hidden relationships or recurring issues not obvious in single events.
Status/Tooltip: "Detecting trends, outliers, or recurring failure patterns..."
D. Root Cause Identification
What: Uses rules, logic trees (Fault Tree for assets; ECFA for safety), and/or ML inference to propose root/contributing causes.
Why: Delivers data-driven diagnosis, not just symptom reporting.
Status/Tooltip: "Diagnosing root causes and contributing factors..."
E. Recommendations Generation
What: Links findings to actionable recommendations—corrective, preventive, process, or training changes.
Why: Makes analysis actionable for improvement.
Status/Tooltip: "Suggesting targeted corrective and preventive actions..."
4. Fault Tree & ECFA Logic

A. Fault Tree (Plant Assets):

Use a knowledge base and/or editable logic trees for mapping symptoms → causes → root cause.
Each equipment type must have associated fault tree logic, tailored to common failure modes per ISO 14224 and FMEA/FMECA libraries.
Allow admin editing of tree structure/rules for customization.
B. ECFA (Safety Events):

Build timeline of events, actions, and conditions leading to incident.
Mark causal and contributing factors (human, system, environmental, design, management).
Visualize as event-causal factor chart (nodes: event, contributing, barrier, outcome).
5. Output & Visualization

RCA output must include:
Asset/event context and details
Step-by-step logic leading to root and contributing causes (with supporting evidence cited)
Visual: Fault tree or ECFA chart (downloadable/exportable)
Recommendations, confidence scores, and required follow-ups
Links to all supporting documentation and evidence
Output must be explainable, traceable, and auditable (store all input/logic/output for QA/regulatory needs).
6. User Interaction & Audit Trail

Allow users to adjust/edit findings, provide additional evidence, and re-run analysis.
Record all user input, edits, and AI reasoning for each RCA for transparency and learning.
Provide “Help” tooltips on each workflow/status step (see explanations above).
7. Admin & Security

Only admin can configure/modify equipment taxonomy, RCA/ECFA logic rules, or upload AI provider keys (e.g., OpenAI API).
API keys and sensitive configs stored securely, never exposed client-side.
Role-based access for evidence editing, RCA validation, and report approval.
8. ISO 14224 Equipment Taxonomy

(High-level; must be implemented as dynamic dropdown/lookup table, expandable by admin)

Rotating: Pumps (centrifugal, reciprocating, rotary), Compressors, Turbines, Motors, Fans, Blowers, Mixers
Static: Vessels, Exchangers, Boilers, Columns, Filters, Tanks, Piping, Valves
Electrical: Switchgear, Transformers, Breakers, UPS, Cables
Instrumentation/Control: Sensors, Transmitters, Valves, Analyzers, PLC/DCS
Support: HVAC, Cranes, Fire Protection
See ISO 14224 for further breakdown as needed.
9. Testing, Validation, and Continuous Improvement

Thoroughly test forms, AI workflow, and logic trees for each equipment class and safety event scenario (using both full and partial data).
Allow admin to refine question lists, logic, and outputs based on user feedback and post-event audits.
10. Deliverables

Dynamic evidence-gathering questionnaire/forms (with conditional logic per equipment/event type)
Data parser and validator (with user prompts for missing/invalid data)
Integrated NLP extraction for free text
Pattern recognition engine
Fault tree (plant asset) and ECFA (safety event) logic implementation
Explainable, evidence-linked RCA/ECFA output with visualization
Admin panel for taxonomy, logic, user roles, and API key management
Comprehensive audit trail and export/reporting functions
Summary

Start with the forms: No RCA analysis should occur until all required evidence is collected.
Build the AI/logic engine: Use structured, explainable logic—fault tree for assets, ECFA for safety.
Design for auditability: Every step, decision, and user input is tracked.
Make it modular: Easy to expand with new equipment types, logic rules, and evidence questions.
