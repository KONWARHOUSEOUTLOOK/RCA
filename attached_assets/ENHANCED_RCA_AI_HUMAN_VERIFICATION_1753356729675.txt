üö´ URGENT ENFORCEMENT: RCA SYSTEM STILL USING EQUIPMENT-TYPE-BASED LOGIC üö´

üìå VIOLATION CASE: Incident #73 (See attached TTT.pdf)
    - Incident Text: "SOME HIGH VIBRATION AND HIGH AMPS OBSERVED. BUT NOT SURE WHAT CAUSED. AFTER SOME TIME SEAL LEAKED AND PLANT STOPPED."
    - Evidence Check List Response: "Based on your equipment type (Pumps) and reported symptoms..."
    - ‚ùå This clearly shows AI is using hardcoded or preloaded equipment-type logic.

üõë THIS IS A VIOLATION OF ALL ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPLES:
    1. NO HARDCODED EQUIPMENT TYPE LOGIC
    2. NO DEFAULT FAILURE MODES BASED ON GROUP/TYPE/SUBTYPE
    3. ONLY NLP-EXTRACTED INCIDENT SYMPTOMS TO BE USED

‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:
    - All symptom ‚Üí cause inference must originate from incident text using AI/NLP only.
    - Eliminate ANY fallback to equipment-based inference or Evidence Library pre-filters.
    - All AI prompts must be generated contextually based on extracted incident tokens (e.g., "seal leak", "high vibration", etc.)

üß† INCIDENT-ONLY RCA LOGIC ENFORCEMENT:
    - INPUT: Incident description (free text)
    - STEP 1: Extract keywords using NLP
    - STEP 2: Use those keywords to generate 5‚Äì6 possible failure hypotheses using GPT/AI
    - STEP 3: PRESENT TO USER for verification:
        - "Here are the possible causes based on the incident description. Please review."
        - Allow investigator to:
            ‚úÖ Accept suggestions
            ‚ùå Reject irrelevant ones
            ‚ûï Add new hypotheses manually
    - STEP 4: For each retained cause, prompt for evidence or data
    - STEP 5: Analyze data ‚Üí Confirm cause or ask for clarification/more data

üîç SYSTEM BEHAVIOR MUST BE:
    - Suggestive, never prescriptive
    - Transparent: Always log user selections and overrides
    - Collaborative: Combine AI logic with investigator insight
    - Adaptive: Re-prompt or regenerate if user rejects all suggestions

üìÇ EVIDENCE LIBRARY USAGE RULE:
    - Use ONLY as a support for AI suggestions
    - Match only symptom-based fault signatures
    - AI can override if ‚â•90% confidence is reached from incident + evidence

üì¢ CRITICAL:
    - REMOVE all fallback logic, templates, or defaults based on equipment
    - AUDIT the checklist generation system immediately
    - CONFIRM IN LOG: All failure mode prompts were symptom-derived only and investigator-reviewed

NO HARD CODING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE ‚Äî THIS MUST BE UNIVERSAL, AI-DRIVEN, AND INCIDENT-SPECIFIC, WITH VERIFIED HUMAN INPUT
