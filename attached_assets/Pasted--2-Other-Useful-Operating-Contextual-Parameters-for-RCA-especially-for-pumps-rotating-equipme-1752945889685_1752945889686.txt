**2. Other Useful Operating & Contextual Parameters for RCA

(especially for pumps, rotating equipment, or process equipment)

a) Lubrication:

Oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, oil condition (ppm particles, water content)
Grease frequency, type
b) Electrical:

Current (amps), voltage, power factor, insulation resistance
c) Run Hours / Duty Cycle:

Actual run time since last maintenance
Number of starts/stops (start frequency)
d) Environmental:

Ambient temperature/humidity, corrosive agents, dust, vibration from nearby machines
e) Process Parameters:

Suction/discharge conditions (NPSHa/NPSHr for pumps)
Media type (water, slurry, oil, etc.)
pH, solids content (for process failures)
f) Maintenance History:

Last maintenance date, type of PM done, replaced parts
Previous failure modes for this asset
g) Event Metadata:

Operator at time of failure, shift, alarms active, sequence of events
h) Setpoints/Alarm Limits:

Operating vs. design setpoints, excursions, alarm/fault logs
i) Equipment Specifics:

Model/serial number, age, criticality, modifications/retrofits
**3. How Should AI Use These for RCA?

A) Data Cleansing & Validation
AI checks if parameters are missing or obviously erroneous (e.g., negative pressures, out-of-range readings).
If data is incomplete (e.g., missing lube oil data for bearing failure), the AI prompts user/admin for additional info.
B) Feature Extraction & Correlation
AI extracts trends/patterns, e.g.:
Temperature spike before vibration increases
Sudden pressure drop before failure
Increased power for same flow (sign of wear)
AI correlates events: "Was high vibration always associated with low flow?"
Looks for parameter excursions vs. normal baseline.
C) RCA Logic Application
Maps symptoms/events to likely failure modes using knowledge base or pre-trained reliability rules.
Example: High bearing temp + high vibration + low oil pressure → bearing lubrication failure likely.
Uses Ishikawa/Fishbone or Apollo mapping to link:
Root cause → Contributing factors → Evidence
Provides confidence rating based on data sufficiency and parameter correlation.
D) Recommendation & Evidence Explanation
For each root cause, AI points to the parameter history that supports the conclusion ("Power consumption increased 10% before failure, indicating impeller wear").
If more data is needed, AI lists which parameter is missing and why it’s important ("Please provide lube oil temperature to confirm lubrication issue").
E) Integration into Your Solution
Parameter Table: Add “+ Add Parameter” option for admins (to cover unique equipment)
Evidence Widget: For each finding, show “Supported by” with parameter/time/reference
Missing Data Prompt: If a parameter is typically relevant but missing, show “Missing Parameter” banner and allow upload/addition
Correlation Visualization: Time trend overlays (e.g., power vs. vibration vs. temperature, showing fault development)
Expert System Layer: Use AI to map real data to reliability “rules” and LLM to explain findings in plain English
**4. Best Practice: “Configurable Parameter Library”

Don’t hardcode the parameters—let users (admin role) add custom parameters as needed, mapping them to equipment type/class.
AI can learn over time which parameters matter most for your plant/fleet and suggest new ones.
