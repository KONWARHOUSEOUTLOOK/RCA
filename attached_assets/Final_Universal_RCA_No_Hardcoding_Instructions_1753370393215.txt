🧠 UNIVERSAL RCA SYSTEM INSTRUCTION — STRICTLY NO HARDCODING ⚠️

This document outlines the finalized, universal, schema-driven Root Cause Analysis (RCA) logic for the AI-driven investigation system. It MUST be followed exactly as specified. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES is any hardcoding allowed for equipment types, failure modes, or symptom keywords.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚫 ABSOLUTE RULES — NO HARDCODING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. NO equipment-specific dictionaries, lists, or conditionals.
2. NO static symptom-to-failure-mode mappings.
3. NO preloaded failure modes based on equipment name/type.
4. ALL logic must be schema-driven, evidence-based, and adaptable across industries and assets.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ UNIVERSAL RCA INVESTIGATION FLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ INCIDENT RECEIVED:
- Incident text submitted by user (e.g. "Pump seal leaking continuously")

2️⃣ NLP SYMPTOM EXTRACTION:
- Extract symptoms (e.g. "leak", "seal", "drip") using universal NLP (no keyword list).
- Match only against symptom descriptions in the Evidence Library (not equipment type).

3️⃣ FAILURE MODE FILTERING (SYMPTOM-BASED):
- Use Evidence Library’s `Fault Signature Pattern` and match incident keywords.
- Present only relevant failure modes based on match score (>80%).
- Log match score, evidence type required, and prompt structure.

4️⃣ EVIDENCE PROMPTING (TARGETED):
- Ask only for `Required Evidence` fields from matched failure modes.
- Examples: IR scan, Vibration Spectrum, Pressure Trend.

5️⃣ HUMAN INTERACTION REQUIRED:
- AI shows potential causes (with source explanation).
- Investigator can:
    • Confirm likely causes
    • Add their own reasoning
    • Reject AI suggestion
- AI reprocesses based on updated input.

6️⃣ DATA VALIDATION:
- Uploaded files must be validated against `Required Evidence` rules (e.g. time series, IR image, waveform).
- Junk/irrelevant files must be flagged and cause low confidence score.
- If data insufficient, AI should request specifics (e.g. "Upload IR scan after seal leak onset").

7️⃣ ROOT CAUSE INFERENCE:
- If ≥1 failure mode has >90% match score AND validated evidence → infer Root Cause.
- If <90% confidence → trigger fallback logic.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔁 FALLBACK RCA LOGIC (LOW CONFIDENCE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF:
- No high-confidence failure mode match (>80%)
- Or evidence mismatches known patterns

THEN:
- AI queries LLM (GPT) at backend with symptom context: “List most likely causes of [incident]”
- AI uses that to regenerate filtered failure modes and evidence prompts.
- Investigator reviews: ✅ Agree / ❌ Disagree / ➕ Add More
- RCA continues with refreshed analysis.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔒 EVIDENCE LIBRARY ADAPTIVE UPDATING — WITH ADMIN GATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The system MUST NOT update the Evidence Library automatically.

INSTEAD:

1. AI can propose updates to:
   • Fault Signature Pattern
   • Required Evidence
   • AI Prompt Structure

2. Admin Review Interface must include:
   - Incident Reference
   - Suggested Change vs Current Value
   - Confidence Score / Source
   - Approve / Reject / Edit options

3. Only after Admin ✅ approval → library updates.

4. All edits should be version-controlled and auditable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📂 ALL LOGIC = UNIVERSAL & SCHEMA-DRIVEN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Primary Index: `Group + Type + Subtype`
Failure Modes: Dynamic, symptom-based
Prompting: Based on `AI Prompt Structure` field
Validation: Matched vs `Required Evidence` with structured parser

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ OUTPUT MUST BE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Modular
- Fully schema-compliant
- Auditable (JSON logs)
- Zero fallback to static templates

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL NOTE:
If GPT or any AI is used for inference, it must NEVER be fed hardcoded lists or return static answers.
All suggestions must be dynamically adapted based on schema + incident description.

📛 All logic must be tested with at least 5 diverse equipment incidents to verify generalization.
