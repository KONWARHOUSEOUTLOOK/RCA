Final Escalation – RCA Filtering Violation: Incident #71 (Pump Seal Leak)
==========================================================================

📌 Incident Summary:
--------------------
Test Incident #71:
User Incident Description: "Pump seal leaking continuously, minor dripping noticed"

Observed Behavior:
- Failure modes shown: Bearing Failure, Casing Crack, Impeller Damage, etc.
- Irrelevant modes still displayed despite prior enforcement
- Interface claims "Intelligent Elimination Applied", yet unrelated modes remain

🚫 Critical Violations Confirmed:
---------------------------------
1. Equipment-type preloading still active (e.g., 'Rotating - Pumps')
2. Failure mode list appears tied to group/type/subtype, not just incident text
3. Symptom-based NLP filtering either bypassed, weak, or implemented AFTER preload
4. Evidence Library is still being queried with fallback loading methods
5. ZERO filtering based on pattern relevance score or symptom match threshold

🚫 THIS VIOLATES:
------------------
✔ Hardcoding_Violation_Incident_Report.txt
✔ Evidence_Library_Filtering_Enforcement.txt
✔ Root_Cause_Filtering_Enforcement.txt
✔ NLP_Filtering_Compliance_Audit.txt

✅ Required Immediate Fixes:
----------------------------
1. 🚫 Completely DISABLE equipment-type preloading logic:
   • No Rotating-Static-Electrical based template loading
   • No failure mode lists based on Group/Type/Subtype

2. ✅ ALL failure mode suggestions must be based only on:
   • NLP keyword extraction from incident text
   • faultSignaturePattern or failureModeDescription match from Evidence Library

3. 🧠 Evidence Library query pattern:
   • incidentText → tokenizedKeywords[]
   • match keywords against faultSignaturePattern
   • shortlist only those failureModes with ≥ threshold pattern match

4. 📊 Filtering Threshold Enforcement:
   • If confidence of match < 60%, do NOT show the failure mode
   • No fallback suggestions if nothing matches
   • Instead, prompt user: “Cannot match clear failure mode. Please clarify...”

5. 🔒 ABSOLUTE RULE: ZERO HARDCODING
   • No dictionaries like `equipmentFailureModes`
   • No template-based failure lists per asset group
   • No fallbacks triggered by equipment metadata
   • No static arrays, lists, mappings or switch-cases

6. 📑 Required Log Sample (for Incident #71):
```
{
  "incidentID": 71,
  "keywordExtracted": ["seal", "drip", "leak"],
  "matchedFailureModes": [
    {
      "failureMode": "Seal Face Wear",
      "matchedPattern": "drip",
      "confidence": 82,
      "libraryRowID": "FM012"
    }
  ],
  "eliminatedFailureModes": [
    "Bearing Failure", "Casing Crack", "Impeller Damage"
  ]
}
```

🧪 Test Protocols (Must Pass All):
-----------------------------------
✔ Incident #65: "Motor rotor burnt": Only winding/rotor-related failures shown
✔ Incident #70: "Seal leaking": Only seal-related failure modes appear
✔ Incident #71: "Pump seal leak": No bearing, casing, impeller failures should show up
✔ Vague incident: System must first ask clarification (not preload anything)

📛 Final Enforcement Note:
---------------------------
Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE shall ANY component of this RCA tool include hardcoded logic. The system must operate purely on dynamic symptom-based matching from incident text, using the Evidence Library schema.

Any further fallback to templates, dictionaries, or hardcoded pattern matching violates architectural integrity and credibility.
