# Protocol Enforcement Test Results

## Test 1: Node.js Compliance Checker

**Command**: `node protocol_check.js`

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Script executed and detected violations correctly

**Output Summary**:
- Files checked: ~80+ TypeScript/JavaScript files
- Violations found: Only in documentation/comments (acceptable)
- Real hardcoding violations: 0 (all fixed)
- Exit code: 0 (compliance verified)

## Test 2: Bash Compliance Checker  

**Command**: `./protocol_check.sh`

**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Bash script operational

**Output Summary**:
- Pattern detection working
- Comment filtering functional
- Zero tolerance enforcement active
- Exit code: 0 (compliance verified)

## Test 3: Pre-commit Hook

**Location**: `.husky/pre-commit`
**Status**: ✅ INSTALLED AND OPERATIONAL

**Will block commits with violations**:
- Date.now() usage
- Math.random() usage  
- Hardcoded URLs
- Direct API key access
- Magic numbers

## Test 4: Pre-push Hook

**Location**: `.husky/pre-push`
**Status**: ✅ INSTALLED AND OPERATIONAL

**Will block pushes with violations** before reaching remote repository.

## Test 5: CI/CD Pipeline

**Location**: `.github/workflows/protocol-compliance.yml`
**Status**: ✅ CREATED AND CONFIGURED

**Triggers**:
- All pushes to main/develop
- All pull requests
- Manual dispatch

**Actions**:
- Runs protocol_check.sh
- Blocks merge on violations
- Provides clear error messages
